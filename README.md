## Built
1. Redux storage that can easily and safely change global state.
I built that logic with help of thunk middleware, differen actions, custom hooks and etc.
2. Created strict architecture of the project in which you easily can find different folders or files.
3. Created 3 custom Components with a login inside them.
4. Used socket.io to connect to the server and update state of the app.
5. Used only functional Components with different hooks.
6. Used UI library - material-ui.
7. Used Testing-react-library.
8. Complite few tests that can easily prove app's workability.

## Additions
1. Component Indicator that can indicate positive or neative changings in his value.
2. Switch Component that can "block" tickers for user: if it activated, the
server begins send object where any numbers are 0, any strings are 'denied' and dates are just first.first.first...

## Conclusion
Actually, it was an interesting experience. I've got plenty of fascinating ideas how to upgrade my current app. 
It was my first time using socket.io api, so I learnt a lot of new about client-server models. 
I want to say thanks for everyone ! =)
